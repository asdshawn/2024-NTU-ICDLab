# Integrated Circuit Design Laboratory

## Description
This is a course from Nation Taiwan University (NTU) in 2024 spring semester by Professor [Tzi-Dar Chiueh](https://www.ee.ntu.edu.tw/profile1.php?id=33).

In this course, you will cover the entire IC design flow, including Verilog coding, testbench writing, synthesis, automatic place and route, and post-layout. Each part will include one lab and one homework assignment, along with a team project.

About the team project, your team needs to come up with the proposal on your own, and your work will be sent to TSRI for fabrication.
