**WARN: (IMPEXT-6202):	In addition to the technology file, the capacitance table file is specified for all the RC corners. If the technology file  is already specified for all the RC corners, the capacitance table file is not required for preRoute and postRoute extraction. In a new session, the capacitance table files can be removed from the create_rc_corner command to enable the technology file to be used for preRoute and postRoute (effort level medium/high/signoff) extraction engines.
**WARN: (TCLNL-330):	set_input_delay on clock root 'clk_p_i' is not supported. You should use the -source option to set_clock_latency to provide this offset. You can also use the global timing_allow_input_delay_on_clock_source to allow set_input_delay assertion to have an effect on clock source paths beginning at this clock root.
